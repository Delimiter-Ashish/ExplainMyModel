# ExplainMyModel
ExplainMyModel is an end-to-end machine learning audit and explainability system that evaluates models beyond accuracy, including business risk, data drift, calibration, and interpretability. It provides a modular ML engine, CLI, Flask API, and interactive dashboard, and is designed to be dataset- and model-agnostic for real-world ML governance.
